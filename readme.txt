== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Knowledgebase =
We will maintain and grow a [knowledgebase about Burst Statistics](https://burst-statistics.com/docs/) and analytics & privacy in general.

= Where is the data stored? =
The data is stored in your own WordPress database. Unlike cloud solutions, we have no access to your data. We aim to keep the data as small as possible, and Burst can also automatically archive or delete old data. Read more about [if you need data archiving](https://burst-statistics.com/do-i-need-to-archive-my-data/).

= Do I need an account? =
No, you don’t need an account; no data is sent to another website.

= Is there a limit to the number of visitors I can track? =
No, there is no limit. The only limiting factor is your own database and server.

= Can I exclude IP addresses or user roles from tracking? =
Burst Statistics allows you to exclude specific IP addresses and user roles from tracking in the settings. Burst also excludes most known crawlers and bots from being tracked. Read more about [IP blocking](https://burst-statistics.com/exclude-ip-addresses-from-burst-statistics/) or [excluding user roles](https://burst-statistics.com/excluding-logged-in-users-by-user-role/).

= Does Burst Statistics use cookies? =
There is an option to use cookieless tracking if you prefer. But by default, Burst uses cookies because they are more accurate and lightweight. While using cookies, Burst remains privacy-friendly because all data is anonymous and stored on your server. Read more about [why cookies are misunderstood](https://burst-statistics.com/why-is-burst-privacy-friendly/#misunderstood-cookies).

= Why is Burst Statistics Privacy-Friendly? =
Burst Statistics provides an Analytics Dashboard with anonymized data that is yours and yours alone. Read more about [Why Burst Statistics is Privacy-Friendly](https://burst-statistics.com/why-is-burst-privacy-friendly/).

Burst Statistics can be used without setting cookies or storing data in browsers. However, this can affect accuracy, so a hybrid option with cookies after consent is possible. Read more about [Cookieless tracking](https://burst-statistics.com/definition/what-is-cookieless-tracking/).

= Does Burst Statistics affect performance? =
Performance is almost not affected. We have built Burst to be very performant for your users because we know how important it is for your website. Read more about [Turbo Mode](https://burst-statistics.com/definition/turbo-mode/)
