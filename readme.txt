= Knowledgebase =
We will maintain and grow a [knowledgebase about Burst Statistics](https://burst-statistics.com/docs/) and analytics & privacy in general.

= Where is the data stored? =
The data is stored in your own WordPress database. Unlike cloud solutions, we have no access to your data. We aim to keep the data as small as possible, and Burst can also automatically archive or delete old data. Read more about [if you need data archiving](https://burst-statistics.com/do-i-need-to-archive-my-data/).

= Do I need an account? =

No, there is no limit. The only limiting factor is your own database and server.

= Can I exclude IP addresses or user roles from tracking? =
Burst Statistics allows you to exclude specific IP addresses and user roles from tracking in the settings. Burst also excludes most known crawlers and bots from being tracked. Read more about [IP blocking](https://burst-statistics.com/exclude-ip-addresses-from-burst-statistics/) or [excluding user roles](https://burst-statistics.com/excluding-logged-in-users-by-user-role/).

While using cookies, Burst remains privacy-friendly because all data is anonymous and stored on your server. Read more about [why cookies are misunderstood](https://burst-statistics.com/why-is-burst-privacy-friendly/#misunderstood-cookies).
